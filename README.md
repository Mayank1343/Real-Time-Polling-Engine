## 🔄 Real-Time Workflow

1. User creates a poll.
2. Poll is stored in MongoDB.
3. Shareable link is generated.
4. Users join the poll page.
5. Socket.IO connects users to a poll room.
6. Votes are submitted.
7. Backend updates MongoDB.
8. Updated poll data is broadcast instantly.
9. All connected clients receive live results.

---

## Why Socket.IO?

Traditional polling requires refreshing the page repeatedly.

Socket.IO enables:

- Real-time communication
- Instant vote updates
- Better user experience
- Reduced API requests
- Efficient room-based event broadcasting

---

## Challenges Faced & Solutions

### 1. MongoDB Authentication Errors

**Issue**

Database connection was failing due to incorrect Atlas credentials.

**Solution**

Configured a dedicated MongoDB Atlas user and updated the connection string.

---

### 2. Preventing Duplicate Votes

**Issue**

Users could vote multiple times.

**Solution**

Stored voter IP addresses and maintained a separate Vote collection to prevent duplicates.

---

### 3. Real-Time Synchronization

**Issue**

Votes were updating only after page refresh.

**Solution**

Implemented Socket.IO rooms and emitted poll updates after every vote.

---

### 4. Render Deployment Issues

**Issue**

Backend deployment failed due to incorrect project structure and module paths.

**Solution**

Updated Render configuration and fixed backend imports.

---

### 5. Poll Lifecycle Management

**Issue**

Polls remained active indefinitely.

**Solution**

Implemented auto-expiry timestamps and automatic poll closure.

---

## Future Improvements

- Authentication system
- Poll ownership
- Anonymous voting mode
- Multiple-choice polls
- Poll editing
- Email sharing
- Dark mode
- Vote history
- Admin dashboard
